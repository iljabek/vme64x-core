Running the testbench
---------------------

After having cloned the repository, simply do:

git submodule init
git submodule update
cd hdl/testbench/simple_tb/modelsim
hdlmake
make
sh run_all.sh

This is an automatic testbench with a yes/no status.
It runs the testbench several times with a different scenario value.
The last line should be: OK!

Tested with ModelSim SE-64 10.2a on linux.
